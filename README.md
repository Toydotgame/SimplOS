# UPDATE FOR SIMPLOS 23/4/20

### TSL has, as of 1/1/20, made the decision to discontinue support for the SimplOS operating system for the following reasons.

The "OS" did not really have an architecture and the ability to do many things as it was a preset few pieces of code that really achieved nothing. Furthermore, the files were hard to manage given they were written in Scratch, which is very under-powered and feature-less which makes it horrible to use as a language for making this kind of thing. SimplOS also ran very poorly and had very little interest inside of TSL, thus making it a waste of time and effort to keep up.
The GitHub repository has been archived and will be open for anyone do do whatever they want with it as the liscences will be updated later.

A message from our founder:
  SimplOS _may_ at one point be re-branded under a new name and completely rewritten in a language like Java or C (or C++, C#, etc. one of these C-named things that fit nicely), this also _may_ not happen in the first place, so no promises.
  You're free to take the source and re-make it with a new name and mark it as your own as we do not care for the project's use cases any more, and the work put into it is too small to be kept as "our own", so it is everyone's now.
  
#### We hope that clears things up about where we are headed and we shall see what will become of TSL in the next few months.
